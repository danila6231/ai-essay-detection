## Main Code

The main workflow and code are contained in [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb). The notebook covers:
- Downloading and preparing datasets (including additional data from external sources)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on essay datasets
- Feature engineering (e.g., word counts, TF-IDF vectorization)
- Training and evaluating classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Visualizing feature importances and model results

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Before running the notebook, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
